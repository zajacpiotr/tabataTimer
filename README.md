# tabataTimer
 Application with tabata timer for self use. I used a pure javaScript for application logic and used framework vis.js to show graph with weight, data is stored at Local Storege of browser.
 
 App contains two sites:
 * #### tabataTimer: 
 main part of app, we can set time for workout, rest time and numbers of intervals and we have counter,
 * #### calendar:
 this part contains: calendar on which mark days when You trained (yellow border at days after used a first site of timer), You can put weight at actual day and show it on graph.
